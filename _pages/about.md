# Biography

I am a Ph.D. student at the **School of Integrated Circuits, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)**. My research is situated at the cutting edge of **Micro-nanophotonics** and **Mid-infrared (MIR) Photonics**, with a specific focus on the tailoring of thermal radiation through advanced metasurfaces.

My doctoral research investigates **MIR Thermal Radiation Photonics**, where I explore the fundamental limits and practical applications of thermal emission control. I specialize in designing and realizing metasurfaces that achieve multi-dimensional manipulation of thermal radiation, including **directional emission, dynamic modulation, polarization independence, broadband/wide-angle responses, unidirectional (asymmetric)**, and **nonreciprocal radiation**.

Beyond theoretical design, I possess "full-stack" experimental capabilities. I have independently engineered high-precision **ultrafast laser systems** and **Vacuum Ultraviolet (VUV) coherent sources**, and I am proficient in the entire device pipeline—from **ab initio simulation** and **cleanroom nanofabrication** to the development of automated characterization platforms for MIR optoelectronic devices.

Currently, I am also investigating the integration of **Magnetic Weyl Semimetals** into thermal photonic systems to exploit their unique topological properties for novel radiative heat transfer control.
